### Click on Releases to view all of the Binaries including documents

The Pi IP Address board makes it easier to know the IP Address of your Raspberry Pi when it's connected to a
network. This board is compatible with all Raspberry Pi computers as well as other single board computers that
are pin compatible. The board sits 0.6 inches (or 1.5cm) above the Raspberry Pi. The tops of the header pins go
up to 1 inch (or 2.5cm). The add-on board uses an ATtiny88 by Atmel to drive a 3 digit 7 segment LED display.
There are 16 pins from the ATtiny88 that are brought out to the edge of the board to give the user the
opportunity to increase the functionality of the add on board.
