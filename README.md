The Pi IP Address board is a convenient way to know the IP Address of your Raspberry Pi when it's connected to a known or unknown network. This board is compatible with all Raspberry Pi computers as well as other  pin compatible single board computers (SBCs) like the Orange Pi. The board sits 0.6 inches (or 1.5cm) above the Raspberry Pi. From the bottom to tops of the header pins brings the Raspberry Pi to 1 inch tall (or 2.5cm). The Pi IP address add-on board uses an ATtiny88 to drive a 3 digit 7 segment LED display. There are 16 pins from the ATtiny88 that are brought out to the edge of the board to give the user the opportunity to increase the functionality of the add on board.

The P3 connector is on the bottom left of the LED display and the P4 connector is on the bottom right. Port C & D are brought out through these connectors. This includes the ADC and Analog Comparator inputs are brought as well as the external interrupts.

The Pi IP address board has recently been updated to include a power on message and timeout message if the SBC does not send an IP address within five minutes.

If you have any questions, please ask.
